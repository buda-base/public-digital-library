    <h2>History</h2>
    <div class="col">
      <p>For hundreds of years Cambodia's traditional   manuscripts conserved and transmitted Khmer   literature, history, science, religion, medicine, and   more. Sadly, a large number of these texts—95% to 98%   of the country's traditional manuscripts—were   destroyed during the tumultuous 1970s and 1980s.    As a result, much of the knowledge contained in those   manuscripts was lost, dealing a blow to Cambodia's rich   cultural heritage. </p>
      <p>Through the efforts of the Fonds pour l’Edition des   Manuscrits du Cambodge (Fund for the Preservation of   Cambodian Manuscripts, or FEMC), a project of the   École française d’Extrême-Orient (French School of   Asian Studies, or EFEO) from 1990–2012, tens of   thousands of Cambodia’s surviving manuscripts were   located and cataloged. When possible, these   manuscripts were captured on microfilm or digitized.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <p>Unfortunately, many of these digitized manuscripts are   illegible due to the primitive technology available at the   time. Additionally, approximately thirty percent of the   manuscripts microfilmed by FEMC have now   disappeared from their original locations, meaning   FEMC’s microfilm copies are the last records of their   existence.  </p>

    <div class="col">
      <p>BDRC recognized the extremely urgent need to   document and preserve these manuscripts and, as    the world’s largest digital repository of Buddhist texts,   was uniquely well-positioned to carry out such work.</p>
      <p>With generous funding from the Khmer Buddhist   Temple Foundation, BDRC launched an ambitious   project to digitize and archive the surviving   manuscripts. Thanks to the support of BDRC’s local   project partners, Digital Divide Data and the FEMC,    in just two years The Khmer Manuscript Heritage   Project has now secured digital copies of the surviving   texts for the benefit of future generations and is now   making them freely available to all. Copies of all X<span class="note">[e]</span> digitized manuscripts have been deposited with the   Ministry of Culture[f] and the EFEO and BDRC maintains   this website to ensure free public access to the   manuscripts in perpetuity.</p>
      <p>We are especially indebted to: Kun Sopheap, Leng Kok   An, Mech Khoeun, Chhom Kunthea, Suon Kosal, Suong   Sereykhosal, Vann Narith, Trent Walker, and Alexis   Lecoq. Without their dedicated work, this project would   not have been possible. </p>
