<h3>Brief Introduction of BUDA</h3>

<p>Collaborating with Buddhist Resource and Research Center of Zhejiang University, BDRC developed the Buddhist Digital Archives (BUDA) —— a collaborative platform for Buddhist texts in order to benefit the academic and Buddhist communities as well as public users who are interested in Buddhist texts. With new features and an innovative design, BUDA greatly improves access to a vast multi-language collection of Buddhist works including Chinese, Sanskrit, Tibetan, Pali, Burmese, and Khmer materials. It is open source and as open access as possible. Resources are made available by both BDRC and its partner collections. BUDA was made possible by a generous grant from The Robert H. N. Ho Family Foundation.</p>
<p>BUDA provides deep access with advanced, multi-language search and a query interface that allows users to run custom queries and download custom datasets directly from BDRC’s archive. BUDA offers a variety of tools that facilitate research and promote deep engagement with Buddhist texts. BUDA is an open source platform using open standards, and has been developed to be freely used. Documentation and installation instructions are available on our <a href="https://github.com/buda-base">GitHub page</a>.</p>
<p>The two major technologies underlying the BUDA platform are the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and Linked Open Data.</p>
<p>IIIF is a set of technical standards for displaying and sharing online images. IIIF is being implemented by major libraries, museums, and research institutions around the world because, as articulated on the IIIF Consortium’s website, it is designed to offer “an unprecedented level of uniform and rich access to image-based resources.” BUDA uses the IIIF standards to serve and display its images and provide users with a feature-rich interface.</p>
<p>In addition to using IIIF, BUDA relies on an innovative Linked Open Data architecture developed by BDRC specifically for Buddhist cultural heritage materials. Linked Open Data is a method of structuring information on the web in a way that makes the data machine-readable. That means computers can understand, process, and use the information with less help from a human. This approach yields datasets that are easy to extract, query, link, and update. A dataset using Linked Open Data practices can also be exported as a single, self-contained file, providing for easy long-term preservation. An increasing number of digital humanities projects and libraries are adopting Linked Open Data because it allows linking between separate databases, creating a rich web of interconnected resources.</p>
<p>BUDA’s Linked Open Data schema is designed to describe central aspects of Buddhist cultural heritage—the who, what, when, and where—and includes a rich scholarly model for identifying texts across many languages. Rather than the usual way of linking web pages, Linked Open Data gives archives the ability to connect resources at the level of the data itself. By creating a hub of information, and offering universal, direct access, BUDA will enliven and engage a global scholarly network for Buddhist Studies.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of BDRC</h3>

<p>The Buddhist Digital Resource Center is a nonprofit organization dedicated to seeking out, preserving, documenting, and disseminating Buddhist literature. BDRC was founded as the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center in 1999 by E. Gene Smith (1936-2010). Since its founding, BDRC has digitized, cataloged, and archived over 20 million pages of Buddhist literature including sutras, commentaries, practice manuals, and ritual texts. BDRC stores the works in its secure archive, built to ensure that the texts remain free and accessible to the public into the indefinite future.</p>
<p>Guided by Gene Smith’s far-reaching vision, BDRC has raised the once critically endangered Tibetan literary corpus to a high level of preservation. Today, BDRC’s library is a crucial resource for Tibetan studies, relied on by an international community of academic scholars, Buddhist communities, translators, publishers, and the interested public.</p>
<p>In 2015, at the request of its Board of Directors, partners, and collaborators in the field of Buddhist studies, the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center expanded its mission and, in 2016, officially became the Buddhist Digital Resource Center. In addition to continuing the work started by E. Gene Smith, BDRC is now tasked with preserving and disseminating all Buddhist literary traditions that remain endangered due to precarious social and environmental factors. BDRC applies the technological expertise and scholarly resources it has cultivated for nearly two decades to this most pressing task.</p>
